# README.md
This repository is to store my bash settings and configs.
Feel free to fork it and edit it as you wish. Please read the
through the code and don't just copy and paste. Do not contact me if your system breaks.  

## Installation  
If you have looked through the code and choose to install it in your system follow these steps:  

Create a backup of your files by renaming them like so:  

`mv .bashrc .bashrc.backup && mv .bash_profle .bash_profile.backup`  

Once that is finished, simply clone the repository and copy all the files to you home directory.  

```git clone https://github.com/keystroke3/bashconfigs && cd bashconfigs && cp .* ~/ ```

When this is done, you can apply the changes by executing  
`exec /bin/bash -l` for bash or `exec /bin/zsh -l` for zsh.
